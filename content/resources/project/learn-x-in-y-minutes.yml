description: Learn X in Y minutes is a site for short programming language tutorials
  designed for professional programmers to get up to speed quickly on a new language.
  It started as a blog response to a Lua tutorial I saw on HN. I made my own Clojure
  version, and was encouraged to set up a site and accept contributions via Github.
